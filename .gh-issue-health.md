## Summary
Verify and enhance existing `/healthz` endpoint, add database status check, document in OpenAPI spec, and ensure performance requirements.

## Current Status
The `/healthz` endpoint already exists in `backend/routes/health.js` and returns basic health information. It needs verification, enhancement, and proper documentation.

## Tasks
- [ ] Verify `/healthz` endpoint works correctly
- [ ] Add database connection status to health check
- [ ] Add memory and uptime metrics
- [ ] Document in OpenAPI spec
- [ ] Add Docker HEALTHCHECK directive using `/healthz`
- [ ] Add performance tests (must return <100ms)
- [ ] Ensure endpoint is safe for unauthenticated access

## Acceptance Criteria
- Endpoint returns 200 in <100ms locally
- Includes database connection status
- Properly documented in OpenAPI spec with examples
- Visible and testable in Swagger UI
- Docker HEALTHCHECK configured and working
- Tests verify response format and performance

## Implementation Notes
Current endpoint location: `backend/routes/health.js`
Current response format:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-11-12T...",
  "uptime": 3600,
  "database": { "status": "connected", "readyState": 1 },
  "memory": { ... }
}
```
