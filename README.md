# Tracksy -  an Open-Source Fitness Data Platform
Simplifying fitness tracking and data integration.


Overview
  This project is an open-source alternative to fitness tracking platforms like Strava, focused on providing users full control over their data. The platform supports data integration from a wide range of sources, including Garmin Connect, Apple Health, Android Health, Huawei Health, Coros, Fitbit, Samsung Health, Wahoo, Suunto, Polar, and more.

The platform offers two deployment models:

Self-Hosted Solution: Users can self-host their instance to manage their data independently and set up custom integrations.
Hosted Solution: Subscribe to a managed service with options for integration and a developer marketplace for third-party applications.
Data privacy and user control are at the core of the platform. Users can decide who accesses their data, ensuring complete transparency and security.

Features
  Core Functionality
    Data Integration: Sync data from various health and fitness ecosystems.
    Activity Tracking: Log and visualize activities like running, cycling, swimming, and more.
    Health Metrics: Collect and display metrics such as heart rate, sleep, and recovery.
    Custom Analytics: Generate detailed reports and insights based on your activities.

Deployment Options
Self-Hosting: Tools and guides for users to host the platform locally or on their own server.
Hosted Solution: Managed service for ease of use with all the features available out of the box.
Developer Marketplace
In-App Solutions: Developers can create and sell features or extensions for the platform.
Third-Party Integrations: Use platform APIs to integrate user data with external applications.
Privacy and Security
User Control: Users decide who can access their data.
