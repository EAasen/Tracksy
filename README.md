## Overview
This project is an open-source alternative to fitness tracking platforms like Strava, focused on providing users full control over their data. The platform supports data integration from a wide range of sources, including Garmin Connect, Apple Health, Android Health, Huawei Health, Coros, Fitbit, Samsung Health, Wahoo, Suunto, Polar, and more.

The platform offers two deployment models:

### Self-Hosted Solution
Users can self-host their instance to manage their data independently and set up custom integrations.

### Hosted Solution
Subscribe to a managed service with options for integration and a developer marketplace for third-party applications.

Data privacy and user control are at the core of the platform. Users can decide who accesses their data, ensuring complete transparency and security.

## Features

## Phase 1: Core Functionality and Basic Integrations

### Backend
- Finalize user authentication (sign-up, login, password recovery).
- Complete API integrations for Garmin Connect, Apple Health, and Fitbit.
- Finalize database models and schema for users, activity logs, and health metrics.
- Implement and test periodic data sync mechanisms.
- Ensure logging and error handling is comprehensive and consistent.

### Frontend
- Integrate authentication pages with the backend.
- Finalize the dashboard UI to display activity data and health metrics.
- Refine the settings page for managing integrations and account preferences.
- Ensure mobile responsiveness and cross-browser compatibility.
- Validate UI improvements made in the separate UI enhancement issue.

### Deployment & Testing
- Finalize Docker configurations and ensure both backend and frontend services run reliably.
- Set up CI/CD pipelines for automated builds, tests, and deployments.
- Write and execute unit tests for backend and frontend components.
- Conduct integration and end-to-end tests to validate key workflows.
- Update documentation for API endpoints and integration guides.

### Acceptance Criteria
- All user authentication, data integrations, and scheduled syncing functions are fully operational and tested.
- The web app displays activity data clearly and allows users to manage their integrations effectively.
- Deployment configurations (Docker, CI/CD) are finalized and functional.
- Comprehensive test coverage confirms the stability of the platform.
- Documentation is updated to reflect all changes made during Phase 1.

### API Integrations
To integrate APIs for syncing data from services like Garmin Connect, Apple Health, and Fitbit, follow these steps:

* **Research and obtain API credentials**: Register your application with each service to obtain API keys, client IDs, and client secrets.
* **Set up environment variables**: Store the API credentials securely in environment variables. Update the `.env` file with the necessary credentials.
* **Create API client modules**: Develop modules to handle API requests and responses for each service. These modules should include functions for authentication, data retrieval, and error handling.
* **Implement authentication flows**: Integrate OAuth or other authentication mechanisms required by each service. Ensure that users can authorize your application to access their data.
* **Develop data sync functions**: Write functions to periodically fetch data from the APIs and store it in your database. Use scheduled tasks or cron jobs to automate data syncing.
* **Update database models**: Ensure your database schema supports the data structures returned by the APIs. Update models and schemas as needed.
* **Integrate with backend**: Connect the API client modules and data sync functions with your backend application. Ensure that the data is processed and stored correctly.
* **Test the integrations**: Thoroughly test the API integrations to ensure they work as expected. Write unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests to validate the functionality.
* **Handle errors and logging**: Implement comprehensive error handling and logging for API requests and responses. Use a logging library like `winston` as configured in `backend/config/logger.js`.
* **Update documentation**: Document the API integration process, including setup instructions and usage examples. Update the `README.md` and any relevant documentation files.

### OAuth 2.0 Authentication
OAuth 2.0 is an authorization framework that allows applications to obtain limited access to user accounts on an HTTP service. Here are the key steps to implement OAuth 2.0 authentication:

* **Register your application**: Register your application with the service provider (e.g., Garmin Connect, Apple Health, Fitbit) to obtain client credentials (client ID and client secret).
* **Set up environment variables**: Store the client credentials securely in environment variables. Update the `.env` file with the necessary credentials.
* **Create authorization endpoint**: Implement an endpoint in your backend to initiate the OAuth 2.0 authorization flow. This endpoint should redirect users to the service provider's authorization URL.
* **Handle authorization callback**: Implement an endpoint to handle the callback from the service provider after the user authorizes your application. This endpoint should exchange the authorization code for an access token.
* **Store access token**: Securely store the access token in your database or session for future API requests.
* **Make authenticated API requests**: Use the access token to make authenticated requests to the service provider's API to access user data.
* **Refresh access token**: Implement a mechanism to refresh the access token when it expires, using the refresh token provided by the service provider.
* **Error handling and logging**: Implement comprehensive error handling and logging for the OAuth 2.0 flow. Use a logging library like `winston` as configured in `backend/config/logger.js`.
* **Update documentation**: Document the OAuth 2.0 authentication process, including setup instructions and usage examples. Update the `README.md` and any relevant documentation files.

### User Registration and GDPR Compliance
To handle user registration and GDPR issues in the Tracksy application, follow these steps:

* **User registration**: Implement user registration functionality in the backend. This includes creating endpoints for sign-up, login, and password recovery in `backend/app.js`. Ensure that user data is securely stored in the database configured in `backend/config/database.js`.
* **Data protection**: Ensure that user data is encrypted both in transit and at rest. Use HTTPS for secure communication and encrypt sensitive data such as passwords using bcrypt.
* **User consent**: Obtain explicit consent from users for data collection and processing. Include a consent checkbox during the registration process and provide clear information about how their data will be used.
* **Data access and portability**: Allow users to access their data and provide options for data portability. Implement endpoints to export user data in a machine-readable format.
* **Data deletion**: Provide users with the ability to delete their accounts and all associated data. Implement an endpoint to handle account deletion requests and ensure that all user data is permanently removed from the database.
* **Privacy policy**: Create a comprehensive privacy policy that outlines how user data is collected, processed, and protected. Include this policy in the `README.md` and provide a link to it during the registration process.
* **Logging and monitoring**: Use the `winston` logging library configured in `backend/config/logger.js` to log user registration activities and monitor for any suspicious behavior.
* **Documentation**: Update the documentation to include information on user registration and GDPR compliance. Ensure that the `README.md` and any relevant documentation files are updated with the necessary details.
