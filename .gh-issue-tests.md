## Summary
Add comprehensive test coverage for API v1 versioning structure, OpenAPI documentation endpoints, and API behavior to prevent regressions.

## Current Status  
- Tests exist but timing out
- Framework in place (Mocha, Chai, Supertest)
- Currently working on feature/api-versioning-tests branch

## Tasks
- [ ] Test `/api/v1` root endpoint returns appropriate response
- [ ] Test `API-Version` header is present in all v1 responses
- [ ] Test `/api/openapi.yaml` returns valid parseable YAML
- [ ] Test `/api/v1/health` endpoint
- [ ] Add optional snapshot tests for main OpenAPI spec sections
- [ ] Fix test timeout issues encountered earlier
- [ ] Ensure tests run in <10 seconds total

## Acceptance Criteria
- All tests pass locally and in CI
- Test failures meaningfully indicate missing headers or invalid spec
- No test timeouts
- Coverage includes:
  - API version negotiation
  - OpenAPI spec validity
  - Health check functionality
  - API-Version header presence

## Implementation Notes
Test file location: `backend/test/api-versioning.test.js`
Uses existing test infrastructure with Mocha + Chai + Supertest
