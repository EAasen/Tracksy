### Submitting Pull Requests

1. **Fork the Repository**: Create a fork of the repository on GitHub.
2. **Create a Branch**: Create a new branch for your work. Use a descriptive name for the branch, such as `feature/new-feature` or `bugfix/issue-number`.
3. **Make Changes**: Make your changes in the new branch. Ensure that your code follows the project's coding standards and includes appropriate tests.
4. **Commit Changes**: Commit your changes with a clear and concise commit message.
5. **Push to GitHub**: Push your changes to your fork on GitHub.
6. **Create a Pull Request**: Create a pull request from your branch to the main repository. Provide a detailed description of your changes and any relevant information.

### Code Style

Please follow the coding style used in the project. This includes indentation, naming conventions, and file organization. Consistent code style helps maintain readability and makes it easier for others to understand your contributions.

### Testing

Ensure that your changes are thoroughly tested. This includes writing unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests as appropriate. Run the test suite to verify that all tests pass before submitting your pull request.

### Documentation

Update the documentation to reflect your changes. This includes updating the README.md file, adding or modifying comments in the code, and creating or updating any relevant documentation files.

### Handling API Rate Limits

To handle API rate limits, we can implement several strategies to ensure that our application remains within the limits set by the API providers.

* **Rate limiting middleware**: Implement middleware in the backend to limit the number of API requests made within a specific time frame. This can be done using libraries like `express-rate-limit` in `backend/app.js`.
* **Exponential backoff**: Implement an exponential backoff strategy for retrying API requests after hitting rate limits. This involves waiting progressively longer intervals before retrying the request.
* **Caching responses**: Cache API responses to reduce the number of requests made to the API. This can be done using in-memory caching solutions like Redis or in the database.
* **Batch requests**: Combine multiple API requests into a single batch request where supported by the API. This reduces the number of individual requests made.
* **Monitor rate limits**: Keep track of the remaining rate limit quota and adjust the request frequency accordingly. This can be done by checking the rate limit headers returned by the API.
* **Error handling and logging**: Implement comprehensive error handling and logging for rate limit errors. Use a logging library like `winston` as configured in `backend/config/logger.js`.
* **User notifications**: Notify users when rate limits are reached and provide information on when they can expect the next successful data sync.

### Data Sync Performance

To ensure efficient and reliable data synchronization from services like Garmin Connect, Apple Health, and Fitbit, consider the following key metrics and strategies:

#### Key Metrics

* **Data sync duration**: Measure the time taken to complete a data sync operation. This includes the time from initiating the sync request to the completion of data storage in the database.
* **Data sync frequency**: Track how often data sync operations are performed. This can help in identifying patterns and optimizing the sync schedule.
* **Data volume**: Monitor the amount of data being synced during each operation. This includes the number of records and the size of the data.
* **API request success rate**: Measure the success rate of API requests made during data sync operations. This helps in identifying issues with API integrations and ensuring reliable data retrieval.
* **Error rate**: Track the number of errors encountered during data sync operations. This includes API errors, network errors, and data processing errors.
* **Resource utilization**: Monitor the CPU, memory, and network usage during data sync operations. This helps in identifying performance bottlenecks and optimizing resource allocation.
* **Latency**: Measure the latency of API requests made during data sync operations. This helps in identifying slow API responses and optimizing the sync process.
* **Data integrity**: Ensure the accuracy and completeness of the data being synced. This includes verifying that all expected data is retrieved and stored correctly in the database.
* **User impact**: Monitor the impact of data sync operations on user experience. This includes tracking any delays or disruptions caused by data sync activities.

#### Strategies for Improvement

* **Batch inserts and updates**: Instead of inserting or updating records one by one, use batch operations to reduce the number of database transactions.
* **Indexing**: Ensure that the database tables have appropriate indexes to speed up query performance, especially for frequently accessed columns.
* **Database connection pooling**: Use connection pooling to manage database connections efficiently and reduce the overhead of establishing new connections.
* **Parallel requests**: Make API requests in parallel where possible to reduce the overall data sync time.
* **Rate limit management**: Implement strategies to handle API rate limits, such as exponential backoff and caching responses.
* **Retry mechanism**: Implement a retry mechanism with exponential backoff for failed API requests to ensure data sync reliability.
* **Detailed logging**: Use the `winston` logging library configured in `backend/config/logger.js` to log detailed information about data sync operations, including start and end times, data volume, and any errors encountered.
* **Performance metrics**: Monitor key metrics such as data sync duration, data volume, and API request success rate to identify performance bottlenecks and optimize the sync process.
* **Alerting**: Set up alerts for critical issues, such as high error rates or prolonged data sync durations, to enable timely intervention and resolution.
