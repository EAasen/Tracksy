## Summary
Implement security and observability enhancements including health checks, Docker healthchecks, README badges, bundle size budgets, and OpenAPI linting preparation.

## Rationale
These incremental improvements will:
- Reduce future toil through automated updates
- Surface regressions earlier via bundle stats and healthchecks
- Prepare platform for API versioning and scalability work
- Enhance security posture and supply chain hygiene

All tasks are non-breaking, self-contained enhancements.

## Tasks

### Health & Monitoring
- [ ] Backend health endpoint (`/healthz`) returning JSON: `{ status: 'ok', uptime, timestamp }`
- [ ] Backend container HEALTHCHECK using curl hitting `/healthz`
- [ ] Health endpoint responds <100ms with minimal logic

### Documentation & Visibility
- [ ] README badges for:
  - Security Audit workflow status
  - Bundle Stats workflow status
  - Dependabot status
- [ ] Add `npm run analyze` documentation section in README
- [ ] Document bundle stats usage and interpretation

### Performance Budgets
- [ ] Configure initial bundle size thresholds (advisory):
  - Main bundle warn at 450KB
  - Main bundle error at 600KB
- [ ] Extend bundle stats workflow to enforce error level
- [ ] Document performance budget strategy

### API Quality Preparation
- [ ] Add Spectral (OpenAPI linter) placeholder config (`.spectral.yaml`)
- [ ] Configure for future API spec checks
- [ ] Ensure YAML lints without error

### Dependency Management
- [ ] Create `docs/dependency-management.md`
- [ ] Document Dependabot vs Renovate evaluation
- [ ] Document decision path and rationale
- [ ] Define dependency update strategy

## Acceptance Criteria
1. All changes compatible with existing Docker workflows
2. Health endpoint returns HTTP 200 within <100ms
3. All CI workflows remain green
4. README badges display correctly
5. All config files (YAML/JSON) lint without error
6. Documentation complete and accurate

## Out of Scope
- API versioning implementation (covered in #61)
- Full performance budget automation (initial warning only)
- Dependency major upgrades beyond safe versions

## Risk Mitigation
| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Healthcheck flakiness on cold start | Add `start_period` and sensible retry count |
| Bundle size variability | Use advisory thresholds first, fail only on extreme oversize |
| Tool overlap (Dependabot vs Renovate) | Document decision path before adding second tool |

## Implementation Order
1. Health endpoint + Docker healthcheck (backend)
2. README badges
3. Bundle stats workflow enhancement (threshold logic)
4. Spectral config stub
5. Dependency management documentation

## Metrics to Track (Future)
- % of PRs auto-updated successfully
- Mean time to detect oversized bundle regressions
- Healthcheck success ratio across restarts

## Related Issues
- Builds on #59 (security foundation)
- Prepares for #61 (API versioning)
- Related to #117 (Spectral CI - this creates placeholder config)
- Related to #114 (Health endpoint - partial overlap)

## Epic
#46: Privacy-First Docker Development Stack
