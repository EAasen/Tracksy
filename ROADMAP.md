## üîê Post-Security Follow-ups (Backlog)
Following completion of **#59** (dependency/security hardening), a focused set of incremental improvements has been identified to strengthen operational readiness and observability. These will be tracked under a new issue: **Security & Observability Follow-ups** (pending issue number assignment).

Planned tasks:
- Backend health endpoint + Docker healthcheck
- README workflow & dependency badges
- Bundle size advisory thresholds + stats workflow enhancement
- OpenAPI lint (Spectral) config stub for upcoming API spec (#61)
- Dependency management strategy note (Dependabot vs Renovate)

See: `docs/issue-security-followups.md` for full details and acceptance criteria.

### üåê API Documentation & Versioning Follow-ups (Backlog)
With the initial `/api/v1` and OpenAPI scaffold in place, the following incremental tasks are staged as discrete issues (to be created on GitHub):

- Flesh Out OpenAPI Paths & Schemas (`docs/issues/issue-api-spec-paths.md`)
- Add Spectral Lint CI (`docs/issues/issue-api-spectral-ci.md`)
- Implement /healthz Endpoint & Spec (`docs/issues/issue-api-health-endpoint.md`)
- Standardize API Error Response Format (`docs/issues/issue-api-error-standardization.md`)
- Header-Based API Version Negotiation (`docs/issues/issue-api-version-negotiation.md`)
- Minimal API Versioning & Docs Tests (`docs/issues/issue-api-tests-minimal.md`)
- Generate Typed Client from OpenAPI (`docs/issues/issue-api-typed-client.md`)
- Add x-changelog Extensions to OpenAPI (`docs/issues/issue-api-changelog-extensions.md`)
- Modularize OpenAPI Spec (`docs/issues/issue-api-modularize-spec.md`)

These can be prioritized based on risk reduction (error standardization, health endpoint) vs productivity (typed client) and governance (Spectral CI, modularization).
