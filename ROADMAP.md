- **User Testing and Feedback Collection**

## üí¨ Development Notes

### MVP-First Approach
- **Priority:** Complete adventure platform MVP in 14 weeks before expanding advanced features
- **Technical Stack:** Proven technologies (Node.js, React, PostgreSQL) for reliable foundation  
- **Scope Management:** Clear MVP boundaries prevent feature creep

### Key Development Principles
- Adventure platform features integrate seamlessly with existing fitness tracking
- Trail database supports multiple data sources (AllTrails, Komoot, etc.)
- Mobile apps prioritize offline functionality for remote adventure areas
- External provider integration supports modular addition of new providers
- AI assistant extensible for adventure planning, nutrition, exercise, and motivation
- Admin features include bulk actions, audit trails, and permission management
- UI/UX improvements are user-tested and accessibility-compliant
- Security regularly reviewed with focus on location data privacy
- Documentation kept up-to-date with every major feature release
- **Post-MVP Development:** Focus on user feedback and community building

### Issue Management Best Practices
- Use labels effectively for filtering and organization
- Link related issues using GitHub's issue references
- Update issue status regularly and close completed tasks
- Use milestones to track phase progress
- Add time estimates and assignees for better planning
- Reference issues in commit messages for traceability
