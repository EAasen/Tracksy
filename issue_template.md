## Overview
Create a revolutionary universal readiness and recovery system that intelligently combines data from all activity types (endurance, strength, yoga, etc.) to provide one holistic recommendation about training readiness - the "killer feature" that no current platform offers.

## User Stories
- As a multi-sport athlete, I want one unified readiness score that considers my cycling, running, and strength training
- As a holistic health user, I want my yoga and meditation to factor into my training recommendations
- As a busy professional, I want the platform to know when work stress should affect my training intensity
- As a data-driven athlete, I want the most comprehensive readiness assessment available anywhere

## Technical Requirements

### Universal Data Integration
- [ ] Multi-sport activity impact assessment (endurance, strength, flexibility)

- [ ] Recovery activity prescriptions (yoga, walking, massage)
- [ ] Cross-training recommendations for balance
- [ ] Deload and rest recommendations with timing
- [ ] Performance prediction for planned activities

### Holistic Health Assessment
- [ ] Mental health and stress impact on physical readiness
